# Vintage Story Docker Server

This repository contains a Docker setup for running a Vintage Story game server in an easy and flexible way.

## How to Set Up

To set up your Vintage Story server, you have two options: using Docker Compose for an easy setup or manually building the image.

### Option 1: Easy Setup with Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
3. Set the environment variable `DATA_PATH` to define where the server should save generated data. You can define this in a `.env` file or directly when running the container.
   
   Example `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/data
   ```

4. Run the server using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Hereâ€™s a snippet of the `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   services:
     vintagestory_server:
       image: tbh:latest
       environment:
         - DATA_PATH=${DATA_PATH:-./data}
       volumes:
         - ${DATA_PATH}:/var/vintagestory/data
       ports:
         - "42420:42420"
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Building the Image)

If you prefer to build the image manually, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository folder.
3. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t tbh .
   ```

4. Run the server using the `docker run` command, setting the `DATA_PATH` environment variable:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -e DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/data -v /path/to/your/data:/var/vintagestory/data -p 42420:42420 tbh
   ```

## Features

- **Simple Setup**: Easily run a Vintage Story server using Docker Compose or Docker commands.
- **Data Persistence**: Server data is saved to a configurable location on your host system.
- **Future Plans**:
  - Remote console access
  - Improved configuration management
  - Automatic backups and more!
